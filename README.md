# Data Scraping with chrome scraper

This project aims to scrap data to populate the new [Immigrant Guide](https://immigrantguide.org/) website still under construction.
Data is extracted using the [chrome Web Scraper](https://www.webscraper.io/) before being formatted to specification. Some of the categories include immigration lawyers, community-based organizations and among others.
